# Agmar LSTM Model

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting the modal price of a commodity based on the historical data provided in the "arecanut.csv" dataset.

## Project Overview

The main steps of the project are as follows:

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by converting the "Price Date" column to datetime format. The relevant columns are selected, and the data is scaled using the MinMaxScaler.

2.  **Model Building**: A sequential LSTM model is constructed using Keras. It consists of two LSTM layers and a dense output layer.

3.  **Model Training**: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and trained on the preprocessed data.

4.  **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using the testing data, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared are calculated as evaluation metrics.

5.  **Prediction and Visualization**: The model is utilized to make predictions on the testing data, and the results are visualized by comparing the actual and predicted values.

6.  **Model Saving**: The trained LSTM model is saved to a file named "model.h5" and the scaler is saved to "scaler.gz" for future use in a web application.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need:

* Python 3.10.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* tensorflow
* FastApi
* joblib

## Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```shell
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow flask flask_cors joblib
    ```

2.  **Train the Model**:
    Run the `lstm_adike.ipynb` and `lstm_patora.ipynb` script to train the model and generate `model_adike.keras`,`model_patora.keras` and `scaler_adike.gz`,`scaler_patora.gz`.
    

3.  **Run the Web App**:
    Start the Flask server by running `app.py`.
    ```shell
    python app.py
    ```

4.  **View the Predictor**:
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You should see the price predictor interface. Click the "Predict Tomorrow's Price" button to get a prediction.
